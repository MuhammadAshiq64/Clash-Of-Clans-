The game is set in a fantasy-theme persistent world where the player is a chief of a village. Clash of Clans tasks players to build their own village using the resources gained from attacking other player's villages with troops; earning rewards, buying them with medals or by producing them at their own village. The main resources are gold, elixir and dark elixir. Players can conjoin to create clans, groups of up to fifty people, who can then participate in Clan Wars together, donate and receive troops, and chat with each other. The minimum number of players of a Clan War is thirty. 


Clash of Clans was released to generally positive reviews from critics.
